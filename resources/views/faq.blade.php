            <p>For sale by owner has been around as long as the real estate industry, however, it has not been supported by the best technology…until now! By doing it yourself, you can walk away with tens of thousands of dollars more in your pocket by avoiding commissions. As a buyer, you will benefit by working with your own schedule (no more waiting around) and knowing that you received a fair deal for the property through Suuty’s transparent home auctions.</p>

            <p>The seller will enter their target price and desired timeframe for offers. Prospective purchasers can offer their desired price for a particular property until the closing date.
              These offers will be transparent to everyone. At the end of the timeframe the seller will accept an offer that is the best for their circumstance and move into negotiation. This is true “market pricing”! Suuty will then assist both parties drawing up all the paperwork and ensuring the deal is legit.  All you have to do is start planning your move!</p>

            <p>When someone lists their home through a real estate agent, they will be responsible for paying realtor’s fees to both their agent and the agent representing the buyer. You can save this money by listing and selling the house on your own. Suuty provides a powerful platform that performs most of the functions that a realtor would which allows you to save the money. Suuty also allows buyers and sellers to participate in a transparent auction process which will ensure offers are at market price. Today’s hot market means many of these offers are behind closed doors.</p>
