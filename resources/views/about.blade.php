          <h4 style="text-align:center">
            <b>At Suuty, we believe everyone should be able to buy and sell their home themselves, directly and transparently, without paying tens of thousands of dollars in realtors’ fees.</b>
          </h4>
          <p>  Suuty is a transparent marketplace that connects homeowners with buyers.
            This allows buyers and sellers to interact directly with each other, eliminating traditional commissions in the process.
            We are driven by the vision to facilitate a fair deal for all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded in Vancouver, BC by technology entrepreneur Marilouise Muller, Suuty is an online real estate marketplace platform that connects home sellers
            with home buyers and allows them to connect, message, negotiate, buy, sell and transfer legal documents directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transparency is key to Suuty’s bidding process. When an offer is made on a property, the amount is visible to other potential buyers, who can then make,
             not make or adjust their own offer amounts. Suuty protects each potential buyers’ identity and information—only the seller can see who has made the offers.
              Only the offer amount in dollars is visible to other potential buyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suuty’s proprietary and secure document transfer protocol creates and fills in the documents that allows potential buyers to make legal offers to sellers through Suuty, and for sellers to legally accept these offers on Suuty.
            When an offer is accepted, the buyer and seller then take the papers to a Notary Public to complete the paperwork for the transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Suuty, we a driven by our vision to create a fair, transparent, and reasonably-priced real estate market for all.
